# Netflix-Recommendation-System

   In any recommendation system, users and some items are taken into account; in this case, the items are Netflix movies. Tell us what a recommendation system            accomplishes before we continue. In essence, it matches the material based on similarities between a specific group of users and a group of products. Let's examine    this idea in greater detail:

# 1.Contain-Based Filtering
   If a user has read an item or book, for example, and you know they enjoyed it, you can use content-based filtering to identify other books with similar themes. The    material might include anything, such as the author's name, the most popular keywords used in this, the genre of book, etc., and then the user would be recommended    them. Other users, except ourselves, are not included in this kind of filter. The computer will simply choose goods with similar content to recommend to us based on    what we like.


# 2. Collaborative Filtering
  Based on user ratings, this kind of filter will suggest films that we haven't seen but that users who are similar to us have seen and enjoy. This filter examines the   films that both users have seen and their ratings of those films to evaluate whether or not they are comparable. In essence, this kind of algorithm would forecast     the rate of a movie for a person who hasn't yet watched it based on the similar users' rates by examining the objects in common.


##                  In this approach, we are going to use Content-based filtering since the data we are using does not involve any user information.
